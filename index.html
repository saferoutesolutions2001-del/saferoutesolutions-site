<h1>Privacy Policy - JRM Utility</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 2026</p>

<p>JRM Utility is developed by <strong>Safe Route Solutions</strong>.</p>

<p>This application does not require user registration and does not collect personal information such as name, email address, phone number, or location.</p>

<h2>Camera Usage</h2>
<p>The application uses the device camera strictly for scanning QR codes required to retrieve Journey Risk Management (JRM) reports. No images or video are stored or transmitted.</p>

<h2>Local Storage</h2>
<p>The application stores the selected Depot ID and downloaded JRM files locally on the user's device for offline access. These files remain within the application's private storage and are not shared externally.</p>

<h2>Cloud Storage and Technical Data</h2>
<p>The application retrieves pre-generated JRM documents from secure cloud storage (Firebase Storage). Standard technical information such as device identifiers may be processed automatically by Firebase services for secure file delivery. This information is not used to personally identify users.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>The application does not sell, trade, or share personal data with third parties.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>All document retrieval is performed via encrypted HTTPS connections.</p>

<h2>User Control</h2>
